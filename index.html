   What is the <strong>best travel time</strong> and <strong>travel distance</strong> between <strong>several origins</strong> and <strong>destinations</strong>?

      <p>The origin-destination cost matrix analysis calculates the least-cost network paths from origins to destinations. It outputs line features that link origins to destinations. Each line feature stores the total network cost of the trip as an attribute value. Analysts often take the attribute table and use it as input for linear programming applications.</p>
      <p>The Origin Destination Cost Matrix service helps you to create an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations. An OD cost matrix is a table that contains the cost, such as the travel time or travel distance, from each origin to each destination. Additionally, it ranks the destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum cost required to travel from that origin to each destination. When generating an OD cost matrix, you can optionally specify the maximum number of destinations to find for each origin and the maximum time or distance to travel when searching for destinations.</p>
      <p>The results from the OD cost matrix service often become input for other spatial analyses where the cost to travel on the street network is more appropriate than straight-line cost. For example, predicting the movement of people in a city is better modeled with costs based on street networks, since people tend to travel on roads and pedestrian paths.</p>
